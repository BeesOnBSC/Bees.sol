Bees on BSC is a token created on May 15th from the idea of safeguarding the lifeblood of
our planet, bees.
Many animals are at risk of extinction, but we must not forget that human life also depends
on the help of these now endangered creatures.
The Unternational Union fot the Conservation of Nature has recorded declines in bee
populations in Europe, Asia and South America
For this reason, Bees on BSC aims to guarantee the sustenance of bees and raise awareness
of their importance by contacting the major organizations for the protection of bees and
contributing with donations and volunteering in the most affected regions.
Regarding the charitable actions we will take into strong consideration the will of the
community and the problems concerning the associations in contact with us.
We start by contacting small charities that need our help. We will choose to donate only
with the certainty that the money will be used forever, carefully checking the validity of
their projects and evaluating the best way to help them.
